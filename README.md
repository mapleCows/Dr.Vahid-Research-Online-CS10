# Zoom Chat Analysis


## Goal
Analyze student and teaching staff chat logs from online lectures. I wanted to figure out how students and teachaing staff are using the chat functionality. How often chat is used, by who, and when.




#Findings From the analyzis I foudn that majority of the chats are from students and the if the student was to chat once there is a high change they will chat at least 3 more times during the lecuture. More findings/data can be found in the excel and doc.
